# Bootstrap Library
## Why Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is one of the easier front-end frameworks to work with. Bootstrap eliminates the need to write CSS or JavaScript. Instead, you can style your websites with HTML. You'll be able to design sleek, modern looking websites more quickly than if you were coding the CSS and JavaScript directly.

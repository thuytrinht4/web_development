## What is the Purpose of CSS?
In most professional websites, css is kept in a separate stylesheet. This makes it easier to separate content (html) from style (css). Code becomes easier to read and maintain.

If you're interested in the history of css and how it came about, here is an interesting link: [history of css](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html).

CSS stands for cascading style sheets. The "cascading" refers to how rules trickle down to the various layers of an html tree. For example, you might specify that all paragraphs have the same font type. But then you want to override one of the paragraphs to have a different font type. How does a browser decide which rules apply when there is a conflict? That's based on the cascade over. You can read more about that [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/user-style-sheet-3469931).

## CSS for this project
To build the data dashboard at the end of this lesson, I won't actually write any CSS. Instead, I'll use libraries that take care of the CSS for me. In this, that would be the [Bootstrap library](https://getbootstrap.com/).

But if you are interested in understanding what Bootstrap is doing under the hood, then you need to understand how to style a website with CSS. This page has a summary of some important aspects of CSS programming.
